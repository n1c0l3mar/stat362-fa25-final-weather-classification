## Introduction
This repository contains our work for a weather image classification project, where we aim to build a deep learning model capable of recognizing weather conditions from images. Throughout the project, we perform data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and multiple modeling attempts using CNN-based models.

## Dataset 
This project utilizes the Weather Dataset from Kaggle, which contains a collection of labeled weather images. The dataset includes diverse weather conditions, making it suitable for training and evaluating deep learning models.
