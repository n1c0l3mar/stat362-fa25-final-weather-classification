# Weather Image Classification
### Stats 362 - Fall 2025
Team Members: Isabella Toth, Sana Nanlawala, Nicole Marcatoma 

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify weather conditions from images. Our goal is to accurately recognize different weather types by training a CNN-based model on a labeled image dataset. Throughout the process, we performed data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and iterated through multiple model attempts to improve performance and generalization.

## Dataset 
We use the Weather Dataset from Kaggle, which contains a large collection of labeled weather images spanning multiple conditions. This dataset provides enough variation to train, validate, and evaluate our model effectively, making it well-suited for image-based weather classification tasks.
